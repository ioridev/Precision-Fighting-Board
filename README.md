## Description

This project aims to develop the fastest game controller by utilizing the power of [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html). We strive to achieve a polling rate of 8000Hz, delivering unparalleled responsiveness for an immersive gaming experience.

**Note: This project is currently under development and not yet finalized.**  

## Features

- High-speed USB communication using [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
- Targeting an impressive 8000Hz polling rate
- Precise and instantaneous input response
- X-input support

## Installation
Open the PrecisionFightingBoard.TEENSY40.hex file in [Teensyduino 1.53](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_158/TeensyduinoInstall.exe) and write to [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html).ã€€

## Setting Up the Development Environment
Install Arduino IDE 1.8.13 and Teensyduino 1.53.

Clone this repository and copy the x-input/ArduinoXinput_Teensy/teensy directory to C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware.

Open PrecisionFightingBoard.ino with the Arduino IDE, go to Tools, change the USB Type to XInput, and then upload it to the Teensy 4.0.

## Polling rate test results 
I caught the continuous X-input button loop in my Python program and confirmed that it was around 0.125 ms.

The program used for the test is in Precision-Fighting-Board/x-input/tester and anyone can try it out.
